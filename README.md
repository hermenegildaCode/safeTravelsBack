# What you can find and do

This is a mock hotel booking website. It is being built as a way of practising and evolving my angular, spring boot, java, and mysql skills, among other. Since this is a personal project done as a hobbie, there is a certain amount of functionalities and pages available as of now. One can obtain the current (mock) hotels', rooms' and user's data, register users, log in, book hotels, and see bookings. In order to book one has to log in. There aren't any signs announcing that a booking has been done yet, but the booking will be reflected in the "My Bookings" page. One can also observe the 200 response.
